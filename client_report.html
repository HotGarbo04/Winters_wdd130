            <h2>Client Report</h2>
            <p>I decided what content and images to use for my site plan by researching online. I also looked for royalty free images to use. I communicated with my developer in class and through microsoft teams. There wasn't many issues with communication. My developer did meet my expectations for my home page. One of the child pages wasn't formatted very well. The next time I hire a team to do a project for me, I will host regular progress checks, so we know what we still need to do.</p>

             <h2>Lead Developer Report</h2>
             <p>I managed my development team by communicating with my junior developers on GitHub. I had trouble communicating with one of my junior developers. He didn't show up for several weeks, and he didn't send any messages in teams. I found out later that he was dealing with personal problems, so I understand why he didn't come. I assigned each junior developer a page. I communicated to my client through teams and in class. The problem was that I never received a full wireframe of the site, so it was difficult to create it. I published my client's site on GitHub, and sent her a link to it through Microsoft Teams. It was a little difficult to work with GitHub in the beginning, but it's becoming easier to work with it.</p>

              <h2>Junior Developer Report</h2>
              <p>The team lead for Zach's website was really good at communicating to me. I was able to see the vision. The team lead for Tanner's Site was hard to communicate with. I didn't know what was expected of me for Tanner's site, but I knew what was expected of me for Zach's Site. I was able to contribute to both of my sites, but it was harder to contribute to Tanner's site. The lead dev for Tanner's site had problems with GitHub, so I pushed the code on GitHub for him.</p>

               <h2>General Experience and Reflections</h2>
               <p>The most challenging part of this project for me was communication and organization. Sometimes a person wouldn't do anything on the project or talk, so the product wasn't what it could have been. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing the progress of each website. It was interesting how I got to play different roles. If I could do something differently, I would schedule out a specific meeting time with my teams. I need my teammates to show up on time. I feel more confident in working on real-world projects after this because I worked with a client and different lead developers. I now have a little experience with HTML and CSS. I might not be building a website from scratch in the workforce, but I understand how HTML and CSS work.</p>
